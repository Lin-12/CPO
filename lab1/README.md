## Computer Process Organization
### lab1 - data structure
#### basic info
* **laboratory work number** : PLMM 5 
* **variant description** :  Hash-map (collision resolution: open addressing)
* **list of group members** : Liu Jun ; Wang Xin Yue
* **synopsis**:

#### contribution
* contribution summary for each group member (should be checkable by git log and git blame);
#### explanation 
* explanation of taken design decisions and analysis;
#### work demonstration 
* work demonstration (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by an instructor by given command-line
examples;
#### conclusion

After finishing software developing and testing, you should:
    compare mutable and immutable implementation;
    note implementation restriction;
    find possible implementation errors, which can pass some property-based tests.
  Write a conclusion of the laboratory work.
